  abstract = {Forest fires rank among the costliest and deadliest natural disasters globally. Identifying the smoke generated by forest fires is pivotal in facilitating the prompt suppression of developing fires. Nevertheless, succeeding techniques for detecting forest fire smoke encounter persistent issues, including a slow identification rate, suboptimal accuracy in detection, and challenges in distinguishing smoke originating from small sources. This study presents an enhanced YOLOv8 model customized to the context of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images to address the challenges above and attain heightened precision in detection accuracy. Firstly, the research incorporates Wise-IoU (WIoU) v3 as a regression loss for bounding boxes, supplemented by a reasonable gradient allocation strategy that prioritizes samples of common quality. This strategic approach enhances the model’s capacity for precise localization. Secondly, the conventional convolutional process within the intermediate neck layer is substituted with the Ghost Shuffle Convolution mechanism. This strategic substitution reduces model parameters and expedites the convergence rate. Thirdly, recognizing the challenge of inadequately capturing salient features of forest fire smoke within intricate wooded settings, this study introduces the BiFormer attention mechanism. This mechanism strategically directs the model’s attention towards the feature intricacies of forest fire smoke, simultaneously suppressing the influence of irrelevant, non-target background information. The obtained experimental findings highlight the enhanced YOLOv8 model’s effectiveness in smoke detection, proving an average precision (AP) of 79.4%, signifying a notable 3.3% enhancement over the baseline. The model’s performance extends to average precision small (APS) and average precision large (APL), registering robust values of 71.3% and 92.6%, respectively.},

	abstract = {Background Forests are an essential natural resource to humankind, providing a myriad of direct and indirect benefits. Natural disasters like forest fires have a major impact on global warming and the continued existence of life on Earth. Automatic identification of forest fires is thus an important field to research in order to minimize disasters. Early fire detection can also help decision-makers plan mitigation methods and extinguishing tactics. This research looks at fire/smoke detection from images using AI-based computer vision techniques. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach that have been shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods in image classification and other computer vision tasks, but their training time can be prohibitive. Further, a pretrained CNN may underperform when there is no sufficient dataset available. To address this issue, transfer learning is exercised on pre-trained models. However, the models may lose their classification abilities on the original datasets when transfer learning is applied. To solve this problem, we use learning without forgetting (LwF), which trains the network with a new task but keeps the network’s preexisting abilities intact.
Results In this study, we implement transfer learning on pre-trained models such as VGG16, InceptionV3, and Xception, which allow us to work with a smaller dataset and lessen the computational complexity without degrading accuracy. Of all the models, Xception excelled with 98.72\% accuracy. We tested the performance of the proposed models with and without LwF. Without LwF, among all the proposed models, Xception gave an accuracy of 79.23\% on a new task (BowFire dataset). While using LwF, Xception gave an accuracy of 91.41\% for the BowFire dataset and 96.89\% for the original dataset. We find that fine-tuning the new task with LwF performed comparatively well on the original dataset.
Conclusion Based on the experimental findings, it is found that the proposed models outperform the current stateof-the-art methods. We also show that LwF can successfully categorize novel and unseen datasets.},

  abstract = {Viewed as a significant natural disaster, wildfires present a serious threat to human communities, wildlife, and forest ecosystems. The frequency of wildfire occurrences has increased recently, with the impacts of global warming and human interaction with the environment playing pivotal roles. Addressing this challenge necessitates the ability of firefighters to promptly identify fires based on early signs of smoke, allowing them to intervene and prevent further spread. In this work, we adapted and optimized recent deep learning object detection, namely YOLOv8 and YOLOv7 models, for the detection of smoke and fire. Our approach involved utilizing a dataset comprising over 11,000 images for smoke and fires. The YOLOv8 models successfully identified fire and smoke, achieving a mAP:50 of 92.6%, a precision score of 83.7%, and a recall of 95.2%. The results were compared with a YOLOv6 with large model, Faster-RCNN, and DEtection TRansformer. The obtained scores confirm the potential of the proposed models for wide application and promotion in the fire safety industry.}
